Designed and implemented robust CNN architecture for real-time age and gender detection, achieving 88% gender classification accuracy and 70% age group accuracy.
Leveraged TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and Python for model development and deployment. Executed end-to-end data preprocessing on 23,708-image dataset, merging age groups and applying oversampling techniques.
Enhanced model fairness and generalization with high sensitivity of 81.35% for toddlers and specificity of 98.58%.
Introduced MAE as a novel loss function for age prediction, reducing overfitting to achieve training loss of 4.78798.
Utilized data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model robustness.
Conducted performance analysis using confusion matrices and precision-recall metrics, benchmarking against existing literature.
Published comprehensive thesis detailing contributions to computer vision applications in digital identity verification.
